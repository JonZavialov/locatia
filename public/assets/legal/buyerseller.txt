Once the Buyer has made the Buyer Payment for a Buyer/Seller Transaction, the Seller hereby grants the Buyer a limited license to access the applicable Hangout of that Seller to which the Buyer/Seller Transaction relates (“Relevant hangout”).

The Buyer participating in the Buyer/Seller Transaction acknowledges that the Relevant Hangouts license provided in section 5 of this agreement does not result in the Buyer acquiring any rights in or to the Relevant Hangouts, which rights shall be retained by the Seller of the Relevant Hangouts.

<indent>7. License Termination
Except for Hangouts that the Buyer has downloaded, the license granted to a Buyer for the Relevant Hangouts will terminate automatically without notice in the following circumstances:
