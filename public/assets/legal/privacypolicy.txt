It's crucial that the personal data we maintain about you is precise and up to date. Please keep us informed if there's any change in your personal data. You are entitled to request access and correction of the personal data we have about you.

Additionally, if you wish to review, verify, correct, or withdraw consent to the use of (if permitted by your jurisdiction's law) your personal data, you can email us at privacy@locatia.co to request access to, correct, or delete any personal data you've provided. In certain situations, we may not be able to delete your personal data unless we also delete your user account. We won't accommodate a request to change or delete information if we believe the change or deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or render the information incorrect. We may charge a fee for accessing your personal data, but we'll notify you of any fee beforehand.
We may ask for specific information to help us confirm your identity and your right to access, as well as to provide you with the personal data we hold about you or make your requested changes. Laws may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all the personal data we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal data anonymous in line with our record retention obligations and practices. If we can't provide you with access to your personal data, we'll inform you of the reasons, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

<indent>9. Data Security Measures
We prioritize the security of your personal data and employ physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. All personal data you provide is stored behind firewalls on servers with security protections, and we encrypt payment transactions using SSL technology.
The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we've provided (or where you've chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We request that you don't share your password with anyone. We urge you to be cautious about providing information in public areas of the Website, as the information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
Despite our efforts, the transmission of information via the internet isn't entirely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we can't guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. We aren't responsible for any circumvention of privacy settings or security measures on the Website.
<indent>10. Data Retention Policy
Unless otherwise allowed or required by applicable laws or regulations, we'll retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. In certain circumstances, we might anonymize your personal data, rendering it unassociated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.
<indent>11. Revoking Your Consent
Where you have provided your consent for the collection, use, and transfer of your personal data, you may have the legal right to revoke your consent under specific circumstances.

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference you can set in your browser to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect, hence we offer the ability to opt-out.

For more information about DNT, visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
<indent>14. Rights of California Residents
If you are a resident of California, California law may afford you additional rights regarding our use of your personal data. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit CCPA PRIVACY POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

<indent>16. EEA/UK Privacy Rights
If you reside in the EEA or the UK, the following terms apply to you.
Legal Basis for Processing: We may process your personal data either because you've granted us permission to do so, because it's within our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or because we need to process your personal data to uphold a contract with you or comply with the law.
Your Legal Rights: Under certain conditions, data protection laws grant you rights concerning your personal data. These rights may encompass:
Requesting access to your personal data (also known as a "data subject access request"), which allows you to obtain a copy of the personal data we retain about you and verify its lawful processing.
Requesting correction of the personal data we retain about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we retain about you corrected, although we may need to validate the accuracy of the new data you provide.
Requesting erasure of your personal data. This enables you to request the deletion or removal of personal data when there's no valid reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal data when you've successfully objected to processing (see below), when we may have processed your information unlawfully, or when we are obliged to erase your personal data to comply with local law. However, we may not always be able to comply with your erasure request for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Objecting to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there's something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object when we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.
Requesting restriction of processing your personal data. This enables you to request that we suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to retain the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
<indent>17. Requesting the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdrawal of Consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any point if we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legality of any processing done before the withdrawal. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to offer certain products or services to you. We will advise you accordingly at the time you decide to withdraw your consent.
To exercise any of the rights mentioned above, please get in touch with us at privacy@locatia.co.
We do not charge any fee for accessing your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<indent>18. Privacy Policy Updates
Our policy is to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If there are significant changes in how we handle our users' personal data, we will notify you via an email to the email address specified in your account or through a notice on our Website home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes.
